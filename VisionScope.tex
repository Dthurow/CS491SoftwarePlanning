\section{Business Requirements}
\subsection{Background}
Assyriologists study Ur 3 period Sumerian tablets from (?) database. Imp research involves building Sumerian social network for that time period. Current tablets contain corrupted dates which makes it difficult to do NER, a vital part of creating a Sumerian social network. Difficulties include corrupted dates, as well as an unclear year naming system in the Sumerian language which leads to ambiguous year identification. Current need for Assyriologists studying Sumerian texts is a software solution that attempts more accurate date retrieval from tablets using machine learning techniques combined with human (expert) input.
\subsection{Business Opportunity}
Our solution will focus on creating an interface and algorithm for identifying the dates in the tablets. We hope to identify previously unknown or mislabeled dates. The current system has a naive algorithm for determining dates while ours will use a more accurate and less naive algorithm.
\subsection{Business Objectives and Success Criteria}
\textbf{BO-01} Increase accuracy\\
\textbf{SC-01} Significant Improvement
\subsection{Customer or Market Needs}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Interface for non-technical users
    \item Integrate with current system 
\end{enumerate}

\section{Vision of the Solution}
\subsection{Vision Statement}
For assyriologists who study Ur period sumerian tablets, the date extrapolator is a year identifying tool that extracts year information from corrupted sumerian tablets and assigns year ranges as well as allowing expert users to add new tablets and confirm the suggested dates of the tablets.
\subsection{Major Features}
\textbf{FE-01} Has interface which allows expert users to correct the algorithm results.\\
\textbf{FE-02} Uses expert user’s input to update and refine algorithm.\\
\textbf{FE-03} A way to tweak algorithm \\
\textbf{FE-04} Show statistics for each algorithm\\
\textbf{FE-05} Have an algorithm that pulls dates out of the tablets
\subsection{Assumptions and Dependencies}
\textbf{AS-1:} Experts input is noncontroversial and correct \\
\textbf{AS-2:} There is enough time \\
\textbf{AS-3:} Pattern exists in sumerian date to create efficient algorithm \\
 \\
 \textbf{DE-1:} Depending on work of previous group’s work \\
